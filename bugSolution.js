The solution is to move the state initialization to `componentDidMount`. This ensures that `this.props` are properly defined and available.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {}; // Initialize state as an empty object
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.setState({ data: this.props.initialData });
  }
  // ...
}
```

This approach ensures that the component's state is correctly populated using the passed props after the component has successfully mounted.
